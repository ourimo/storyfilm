STORYFILM
---------------
MERN stack application of short stories worth film.


For this app I've used MEAN stack. Only instead of Angular I built client on React. App uses REST api for CRUD operations.

List of everything I've used:
- Node(dev env);
- MongoDB(mLab free storage);
- Express(server and routing);
- React(client);
- AdobeXD(wireframing);
- HTML, CSS(custom design);
